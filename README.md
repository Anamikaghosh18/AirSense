🌟 About

AirSense AI is a fully integrated machine learning platform that analyzes global air quality trends using WHO datasets.
It provides:

🔮 Air Quality Prediction

📊 Clustering of Countries/Cities

⚠️ Pollution Risk Classification

🚨 Anomaly Detection

🎛️ Interactive Streamlit Dashboard

A perfect combination of data science + machine learning + clean UI for research, portfolio, or real-world deployment.

🎯 Problem

Air quality is a major global challenge:

❌ Citizens lack awareness of real air pollution levels

❌ Researchers struggle to explore trends efficiently

❌ Pollution hotspots and anomalies go undetected

❌ Difficult to compare countries/cities fairly

✅ Our Solution

AirSense AI provides:

✔ ML models trained on WHO AQ data

✔ Prediction of PM2.5 / AQI levels

✔ Clustering to identify similar pollution regions

✔ Risk categorization using supervised learning

✔ Anomaly detection for unusual spikes

✔ A clean and intuitive Streamlit dashboard

✨ Key Features
